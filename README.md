# 💬 Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews – Internship Task 2

## 📌 Task Objective:

For Task 2 of my internship, I performed **Sentiment Analysis** on a dataset of **customer reviews** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The goal was to classify each review as **positive** or **negative** using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.

## 📂 Project Description:

✅ Loaded and explored the customer reviews dataset  
✅ Cleaned and preprocessed text data (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)  
✅ Transformed text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
✅ Built a **Logistic Regression Classification Model**  
✅ Evaluated model performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**  
✅ Predicted sentiment (Positive / Negative) for new sample reviews

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib (for optional visualization)

## 🧱 Project Workflow:

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Imported customer reviews dataset (CSV).

2. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   - Removed stopwords  
   - Lowercased all text  
   - Cleaned special characters and numbers  

3. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text to numeric features.

4. **Model Building:**  
   Trained a **Logistic Regression classifier**.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Measured **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)**.
